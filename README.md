# Library Testing (16-bit)

This repository contains very simple code created for testing 16-bit library prepared before (see `TestLibrary-WinAPI` repository) and to learn how to use Open Watcom compiler to compile program which can dynamically use DLLs and resources included in them.

## What to use to compile this code?

The code provided here was made to compile using Open Watcom IDE, which is quite good for modern MS-DOS/WfW3.11 development.
It's possible that it would compile using old Microsoft compilers, but I haven't tested it. It's best to use Watcom for it.
In fact, this project is heavily tied to Watcom coding style, so I think there might be serious problems with compiling it outside such environment.

I've made much effort to provide here working and checked codes with hope it will be useful.
